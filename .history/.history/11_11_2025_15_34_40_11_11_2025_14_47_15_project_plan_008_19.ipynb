    "In this case, I will probably wrangle the data from sessions.csv so that I have separate columns for date and time, because I am interested in the time and not necessarily the date of play. I will also convert the time colum so that the units are only in hours instead of both hours and minutes. I will change the player experience variable into a numerical variable with the highest number 5 representing \"pro\" players and the lowest number 1 representing \"beginner\" players, so that it can be used in regression calculations."
